	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept used in computer science to analyze the efficiency of algorithms. It measures how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the size of the input increases. This helps in comparing the performance of different algorithms, particularly when the input size grows large.

Here’s a breakdown of key concepts:

1. Big O Notation (O())
The most common way to express time complexity is using Big O notation, which gives an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm.
It expresses the worst-case scenario, i.e., how the runtime increases as the input size grows.
2. Common Time Complexities
Here are some common time complexities and what they mean:

O(1): Constant time. The algorithm’s runtime doesn’t depend on the input size. Example: Accessing an element in an array by index.

O(log n): Logarithmic time. The runtime grows logarithmically with the input size. Example: Binary search in a sorted array.</p>
<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the size of the input. Just like time complexity measures the execution time of an algorithm, space complexity measures how much memory is required for the algorithm to run.

Key Concepts of Space Complexity
Auxiliary Space:
This refers to the extra space or temporary space used by an algorithm, excluding the input data. The input data is not counted in the space complexity unless the algorithm explicitly modifies it.
Space Complexity in Big O Notation:
Space complexity is often expressed in Big O notation, just like time complexity, to represent the upper bound of memory usage as the input size grows.
Common Space Complexities
O(1): Constant space. The algorithm uses a fixed amount of memory, regardless of the input size. Example: Swapping two numbers, or accessing an element in an array.

O(n): Linear space. The memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input. Example: Storing the elements of a list or array in a new array.
